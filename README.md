MVC Spring boot project that makes use of PostgreSQL as remote database.
The purpose of this project is to fully understand the process of making and consuming web services, with Kotlin Android as a front-end (this app will appear here soon).

It's documented with Swagger, and it's about to be fully explained right here in a few days
